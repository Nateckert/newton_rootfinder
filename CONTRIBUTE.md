# Contribute

## How to contribute

Classic Github workflow by performing a fork:

1. Do not work on master branch directly.
2. Use features/<features_to_improve> branch mainly.
3. Pull requests should target the `dev` branch
4. Test before push: `cargo test`
5. Use `cargo fmt`.

## Commit naming

For commit updating documentation, it is best if the name of the commit starts with `[doc]`.
For commit updating tests, it is best if the name of the commit starts with `[test]`.

## Call for real world test cases

If you have a test case from you field you want to implement (or even just suggests), go for it !
The more the merrier.

## I want to contribute but I don't know what there is to do ?

Don't hesitate to read TODO.md to see the current developments.
Also, if you didn't find the documentation clear enough, don't hesitate to point at the parts on which you struggled.


Thanks for all contributions!
