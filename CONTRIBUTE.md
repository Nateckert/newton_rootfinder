# Contributes

## How to contribute

Classic Github workflow by performing a fork:

1. Do not work on master branch directly.
2. Use features/<features_to_improve> branch mainly.
3. Test before push. cargo test
4. Use cargo fmt.

## Commit naming

For commit updating documentation, it is best if the name of the commit starts with [doc].
For commit updating tests, it is best if the name of the commit starts with [test].

## Call for real world test cases

If you have a test case from you field you want to implement (or even just suggests), go for it !
The more the merrier.

## I want to contribute but I don't know what there is to do ?

Don't hesitate to read TODO.md to see the current developments


Thanks for all contributions!
