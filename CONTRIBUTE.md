# Contribute

## How to contribute

Classic Github workflow by performing a fork:

1. Do not work on main branch directly.
2. Use features/<features_to_improve> branch mainly.
3. Pull requests should target the `main` branch
4. Test before push: `scripts/run_tests.sh`
5. Use `cargo fmt`.

## Commit naming

For commit updating documentation, it is best if the name of the commit starts with `[doc]`.
For commit updating tests, it is best if the name of the commit starts with `[test]`.

## Call for real world test cases

If you have a test case from you field you want to implement (or even just suggests), go for it !
The more the merrier.

## Check the specification

Check SPECIFICATIONS.md to understand the main focus of this crate.
If you have a use case that you think should be added, open an issue !

## I want to contribute but I don't know what there is to do ?

Also, if you didn't find the documentation clear enough, don't hesitate to point at the parts on which you struggled, as I would love to improve it !


Thanks for all contributions!
